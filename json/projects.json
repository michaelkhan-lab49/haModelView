To derive meaningful results across a variety of platforms, the optimised framework primarily takes a 360-degree view of platform maturity including technology, people, process, and data.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to assess the {{.Project.Name}} maturity, stability, integrity and performance throughout the run-to-retire phase as data is possibly migrated onto new platforms.  The findings from this exercise should be read not only as an assessment of the current state of the system but also provide an actionable path to improvement. Furthermore, it should be noted that to achieve higher levels of maturity ({{.Project.Score.Global}} and up) requires coordinated, cross-organisational effort.\n\nThe assessment framework is based upon a scoring measure across a 5-point scale as an objective indicator to assess system maturity and complexity. The Framework is based upon the following maturity levels:\n\n\u003ctable class=\"table table-striped\"\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n\t\u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLevel\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eTitle\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eDescription\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003c/thead\u003e\n    \u003ctbody\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eInitial\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eSuccess depends on the competence and efforts of key individuals.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eDeveloping\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eTeam-wide process discipline is in place.

Its intent is to communicate relative strength and focus areas across several topics.\n2.\tOverall score: this is a score for the overall assessment. Its intent is to provide upper-level management a general sense of how the service is performing.\n\nThe method used to devise each of the above scores is detailed in the following sub-sections.\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"display-6\"\u003eTopic Score\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe topic score focusses on providing a relative health measure for each topic area, such as Availability and Performance.

Each criterion is associated with a maturity level (0 through to 5). Some example criteria are in the following Worked Example sub-section. \n\nWhen performing an assessment on a topic, each criterion is given a rating. Each rating, along with its associated score value is listed below:\n\n*\tNot met (0)\n*\tPartially met (0.5)\n*\tMet or Exceeded (1)\n\nThis provides us with the following interim values for the topic:\n\n*\tA max maturity for the assessment: this is one level below the maturity of the first occurrence of a “Not Met” criteria.  This is based upon the rationale that a topic’s current maturity should always fall short of the first observed unmet criteria.\n*\tA base score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias up to the max maturity\n*\tThe base number of criteria : number of criterias forming the base raw score\n*\tAn extended score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias above max maturity\n*\tThe extended number of criteria : number of criterias forming the extended raw score\n\nThe final score for this topic is then calculated as follows:\n(base score / base number of criteria * max maturity) + (extended score/extended number of criterias)\nThe final score is then rounded to 1 decimal point.\n\nThe following sub-section walks through a worked example.\nWorked Example\nBelow is a slimmed down version of the criteria for Availability topic for example purposes.

Data collected is being used for monitoring and reporting purposes. This data is not actively correlated with other metrics to proactively manage the platform to perform any pre-emptive remediation.\n* Little to no availability testing at a granular level of multiple failure scenarios in non-production environments.\n* TCS performs testing as defined below though interviews confirm that no comparison is taking place between results and ARC tier requirements.\n  * SCAT testing taking place annually\n  * MERT testing is taking place on a biannual basis, collection of results does not undergo review resulting in system improvement\n  * Service continuity testing is taking place twice a year.\n  * Security testing is being applied as requested by CBA IT Security recommendations.\n* TCS retains a measure of SLAs and SLOs however they make no comparison with CBA app target SLAs and SLOs\n* Business continuity tests are performed bi-annually at data centre level. All upstream stream and downstream applications take part in this failover simulation.\n* Disaster recovery is taking place at a platform level however no evidence exists of it taking place at a business function level.",
          "risk": "* Environments, systems, and dependent components have varying probabilities of failure, and the limited discoverability via group tooling of such potential failures and their cascading impacts may result in the inability of the organisation to accurately risk assess change and mitigate risks to the Accurate Platform.\n* Neglect in comparing availability results with SLOs and SLAs established for the system would indicate that no tangible goals exist.\n* Availability Test Report is not portraying an accurate depiction of uptime, this conceals underlying outages and prevents them being addressed methodically.\n* Absence of granular availability testing, mean production availability cannot be guaranteed in the event of specific failures, e.g., app, web, database, network, or dependent components.\n* Lack of automation impacts the teams? ability to repeatably and consistently assure uptime. This may result in longer availability testing cycles and inconsistencies in results, thereby impacting the overall platform availability.",
          "recommendation": "* **Conduct regular reviews of SLAs/SLOs.** Conduct regular reviews to compare SLOs and SLAs to application performance targets.\n* **Comprehensive automated availability testing.** More comprehensive availability and failover testing in non-production environments must be set up. It should be possible to test multiple failure scenarios in a non-production setting, in an environment that is equivalent to production. Ideally, this would use scripting and automation tooling.",

The Framework is based upon the following maturity levels:\n\n\u003ctable class=\"table table-striped\"\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n\t\u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLevel\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eTitle\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eDescription\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003c/thead\u003e\n    \u003ctbody\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eInitial\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eSuccess depends on the competence and efforts of key individuals.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eDeveloping\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eTeam-wide process discipline is in place.

Its intent is to communicate relative strength and focus areas across several topics.\n2.\tOverall score: this is a score for the overall assessment. Its intent is to provide upper-level management a general sense of how the service is performing.\n\nThe method used to devise each of the above scores is detailed in the following sub-sections.\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"display-6\"\u003eTopic Score\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe topic score focusses on providing a relative health measure for each topic area, such as Availability and Performance.

Each criterion is associated with a maturity level (0 through to 5). Some example criteria are in the following Worked Example sub-section. \n\nWhen performing an assessment on a topic, each criterion is given a rating. Each rating, along with its associated score value is listed below:\n\n*\tNot met (0)\n*\tPartially met (0.5)\n*\tMet or Exceeded (1)\n\nThis provides us with the following interim values for the topic:\n\n*\tA max maturity for the assessment: this is one level below the maturity of the first occurrence of a “Not Met” criteria.  This is based upon the rationale that a topic’s current maturity should always fall short of the first observed unmet criteria.\n*\tA base score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias up to the max maturity\n*\tThe base number of criteria : number of criterias forming the base raw score\n*\tAn extended score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias above max maturity\n*\tThe extended number of criteria : number of criterias forming the extended raw score\n\nThe final score for this topic is then calculated as follows:\n(base score / base number of criteria * max maturity) + (extended score/extended number of criterias)\nThe final score is then rounded to 1 decimal point.\n\nThe following sub-section walks through a worked example.\nWorked Example\nBelow is a slimmed down version of the criteria for Availability topic for example purposes.

To derive meaningful results across a variety of platforms, the optimised framework primarily takes a 360-degree view of platform maturity including technology, people, process, and data.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to assess the {{.Project.Name}} maturity, stability, integrity and performance throughout the run-to-retire phase as data is possibly migrated onto new platforms.  The findings from this exercise should be read not only as an assessment of the current state of the system but also provide an actionable path to improvement. Furthermore, it should be noted that to achieve higher levels of maturity ({{.Project.Score.Global}} and up) requires coordinated, cross-organisational effort.\n\nThe assessment framework is based upon a scoring measure across a 5-point scale as an objective indicator to assess system maturity and complexity.

Its intent is to communicate relative strength and focus areas across several topics.\n2.\tOverall score: this is a score for the overall assessment. Its intent is to provide upper-level management a general sense of how the service is performing.\n\nThe method used to devise each of the above scores is detailed in the following sub-sections.\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"display-6\"\u003eTopic Score\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe topic score focusses on providing a relative health measure for each topic area, such as Availability and Performance.  It is expressed as a number between 0 and 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eMethod overview\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor each topic, there are several criteria. Each criterion is associated with a maturity level (0 through to 5). Some example criteria are in the following Worked Example sub-section. \n\nWhen performing an assessment on a topic, each criterion is given a rating. Each rating, along with its associated score value is listed below:\n\n*\tNot met (0)\n*\tPartially met (0.5)\n*\tMet or Exceeded (1)\n\nThis provides us with the following interim values for the topic:\n\n*\tA max maturity for the assessment: this is one level below the maturity of the first occurrence of a “Not Met” criteria.  This is based upon the rationale that a topic’s current maturity should always fall short of the first observed unmet criteria.\n*\tA base score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias up to the max maturity\n*\tThe base number of criteria : number of criterias forming the base raw score\n*\tAn extended score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias above max maturity\n*\tThe extended number of criteria : number of criterias forming the extended raw score\n\nThe final score for this topic is then calculated as follows:\n(base score / base number of criteria * max maturity) + (extended score/extended number of criterias)\nThe final score is then rounded to 1 decimal point.\n\nThe following sub-section walks through a worked example.\nWorked Example\nBelow is a slimmed down version of the criteria for Availability topic for example purposes.

The findings from this exercise should be read not only as an assessment of the current state of the system but also provide an actionable path to improvement. Furthermore, it should be noted that to achieve higher levels of maturity ({{.Project.Score.Global}} and up) requires coordinated, cross-organisational effort.\n\nThe assessment framework is based upon a scoring measure across a 5-point scale as an objective indicator to assess system maturity and complexity.

Its intent is to communicate relative strength and focus areas across several topics.\n2.\tOverall score: this is a score for the overall assessment. Its intent is to provide upper-level management a general sense of how the service is performing.\n\nThe method used to devise each of the above scores is detailed in the following sub-sections.\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"display-6\"\u003eTopic Score\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe topic score focusses on providing a relative health measure for each topic area, such as Availability and Performance.  It is expressed as a number between 0 and 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eMethod overview\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor each topic, there are several criteria. Each criterion is associated with a maturity level (0 through to 5). Some example criteria are in the following Worked Example sub-section. \n\nWhen performing an assessment on a topic, each criterion is given a rating. Each rating, along with its associated score value is listed below:\n\n*\tNot met (0)\n*\tPartially met (0.5)\n*\tMet or Exceeded (1)\n\nThis provides us with the following interim values for the topic:\n\n*\tA max maturity for the assessment: this is one level below the maturity of the first occurrence of a “Not Met” criteria.  This is based upon the rationale that a topic’s current maturity should always fall short of the first observed unmet criteria.\n*\tA base score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias up to the max maturity\n*\tThe base number of criteria : number of criterias forming the base raw score\n*\tAn extended score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias above max maturity\n*\tThe extended number of criteria : number of criterias forming the extended raw score\n\nThe final score for this topic is then calculated as follows:\n(base score / base number of criteria * max maturity) + (extended score/extended number of criterias)\nThe final score is then rounded to 1 decimal point.\n\nThe following sub-section walks through a worked example.\nWorked Example\nBelow is a slimmed down version of the criteria for Availability topic for example purposes.

                  "answer": "messaging solution e2e, every month operation review with LP from their perspective, \n\nideally e2e messaging not just LP\n\n\"I think in terms of availability, we have to look at the messaging solution into end. So the the part that\u0027s we have visibility of every month, we have a I suppose a a monthly operations session with live person where they provide what the availability for that month we\u0027re reviewing is and it only looks at whether up time for live person on their side so.\n\nAnd they provide calculated based on any any known outages. So we and I suppose just on that as well we we we\u0027ve struggled with them for example when we have an incident we had won an early April.\n\nAnd live person didn\u0027t acknowledge that this was an outage in, in, in the sense that it caused negative impact on the uptime of the CBA service. So I think they said it was a 7 minute out which when in reality it was more like a 7, seven and a half hour.\n\nAnd impact to the business cause. Again it it it involves the holder bot and that actually put a lot of more traffic to our contact center agents. So they took a long time to clear the queues that was caused by that issue. So I guess in terms the question availability, we calculate we define it in terms of what we want to do ideally is calculated into wind messaging solution, not just the live person SAS portion. We don\u0027t have good.\n\nAnd are any grasp of once the the solution from the demarcation points of comes into the CBA side where it hits the APIs and all the systems that hang in between like C engine, PGA, Kafka stream we don\u0027t have calculated that as in the totality of the entire service. So I guess that\u0027s.\n\nYeah, that\u0027s pretty much it. You know, I\u0027ll just add to like to add that when we are talking about availability, we just don\u0027t consider life person because life person is just one part of the entire chat solution. So we have something as a front end, we call it as CBA and that is something that we use for more on bank app and that bank and using that customers can send messages and talk to agent at that in terms talk to live person. So live person not available in itself is an incident but then.\n\nThere\u0027s, I mean, there\u0027s not much we can use of for life person as well. So that also is a factor that contributes to availability.\n\nLike integrations like VRC. So if any of those are down as well, again basically it impacts the entire solution. So I will beauty must be when we are targeting or understanding what is the availability we just need we need to ensure all the touch points for that particular solution are available to the customer. All pointer at any point of time.\n\n\""

                  "answer": "ciaran will share lp service management pack\n\n\"only the part where live person provide their basically an uptime availability from their monthly report. I\u0027m just trying to find the latest one\n\nSo this is the monthly service management pack they provide us. UM, so there is Umm on this slide here is this server score card. So you can see there.\n\nAnd April there, they\u0027re saying, and this is the one we challenged 11 minute outage where in fact it was seven hours and they perceived it to be 99.975%.\n\nSo lot of person has two features messaging and live chat. So live chats is as you know speak for itself. It\u0027s it\u0027s instant messaging between our consumers and our live chat agents. Instant messaging take WhatsApp for example while messaging is more like you can you can message an agent for certain product inquiries. It can be parked.\n\nAnd it can\u0027t be responded at certain times when I would assets, you know consumers.\n\nAnd that\u0027s when what we the whole board comes into place. So the message that that queued, that\u0027s part it\u0027s it\u0027s activated by a holder bolts holding that message until such time when the consumers are ready to come back and have a chat.\n\nSo that\u0027s basically the offline messaging part.\n\nUh, so according to them. The chat is 100% available, whereas only the holder bar.\n\nIt just it just features that that cute, that whole that message is for messaging.\n\nWhenever they release hot fixes in in Lloyd Pearson Environment and and take this into consideration, we are not the only tenants that they that have that been set-up on this environment is the I think they got Westpac and they got Telstra whatever but every time they release this this hot fixes it triggered our whole about to be reset when that reset when that reset happened it basically tip all the.\n\nCute messages to sorry, turn the queue messages into active and basically it\u0027s created a lot of panic for for the agents that come online at 8:00 o\u0027clock to say how come all these messages been responding back to the customers so they have to quickly respond back to to these customers or they can put that message back to hold about like manually divertimento hold about 1 by 1.\n\nDonna, just to explain, see these holder box basically will be used when a customer is or a person using CBA is trying to talk to a actual human or agent. That\u0027s where these comes in picture. They\u0027ll hold and then they\u0027ll release it. So in case if they\u0027re down or there is a problem with them, I mean the automatic chat chat will work or the automated component of it will work. But the human component, right, that\u0027s where we start seeing issues because we have like.\n\nGiven an X number of agents only and what will happen? What happens? Is like OK, suddenly they\u0027ll get like 200 conversations. I really there\u0027s an amount that should be assigned to them at any point of time.\n\nAnd which mostly should always be in an open state. So all these issues that we start we\u0027re having for.\n\nIt was like a all these agents were getting flooded or they were getting close conversations and those stuffs.\n\nI mean, because of this life person change when they do a deployment, ideally you\u0027re holder boats right, they will hold your conversations.\n\nWhat happened is or what we have seen recently is we never do a deployment and do a restart. All the conversations which are hold by the which are holded by the holder bot is gets released.\n\nYeah, but back to that point as well it it just if it\u0027s a control release, it is fine. We we have you know we we have live person on standby they they have a they have a method of of watching you know monitoring the the horrible service make sure it doesn\u0027t tip over but it it\u0027s only when when they have emergency releases which is they according to them.\n\nThe whichever the the team that do this hot fixes, they don\u0027t get notified. The service management team. So therefore what they\u0027re not aware that that it in a short period of time, they could just say we pushing it hot fixes in the next two hours and in the middle of the night for example. So no one really across it and therefore we couldn\u0027t do it planning obviously and and when obviously they pushing the hot fixes, this is what causes all the drama reason they say.\n\nSo we we had a about 3P twos in the last two months are related to hoverboards. Yes, we do have an incident covered it, but as I said, if it\u0027s a plan deployment we we do have a you know we we raise the change in our system to say you know the FBI change as you know live person about to do deployment whatever. And then we have a control in place where you know Vibhu\u0027s team would do a health check.\n\nAfter every change, make sure everything is up and running and live person service management team will do the same as well. OK, but.\n\nAs I said, only the hot fix that causes a lot of issues.\n\nAnd just putting the incident number and the and the teams chat there as well, if you want it \n\nIncident related to hotfix: IM3782574 - Live Person - high queues  Size 8000 + - Live person , Agents not able to respond\n\nHere is an incident showing challenges with dependent components the messaging solution rely on on the CBA side: P3 IM3686067- Genesys NEO - \u003cCall Dropping Upon Deflection\u003e\n\nThe proxy network incident (P1 incident) we referred to:\n\nIM3543037 - LivePerson - slow and timing out for agents\n\nC6884673 - CR for the proxy issue\n\nwhat about the other components? do you have availability defined for metrics defined for this, not just defined eyes? Are they available?\n\nAnd DP 2, the digital platform 2, which is hosted on Microsoft Azure, we we get.\n\nMonthly reporting for that? Umm, and we can provide that. So that\u0027s that\u0027s mostly where all the, I suppose not all the APIs but majority of them. But there are other components then downstream from that they\u0027re outside of that if you want to show up in there.\n\nit\u0027s an API that\u0027s sitting on the DP to platform. We do get a availability report on this on monthly basis. I can share the report you guys as well and just be mindful it it\u0027s not obviously it\u0027s not just how API\u0027s that that utilized DP 2 there\u0027s there\u0027s hundreds of so. So yeah we do.\n\nalso have a database component where the API stock to that.\n\nthat\u0027s hosted in a shared environment, but then we have the availability metrics and all that will be available. We just need to talk to the service concerns, service managers.\n\nCaroline will be having both. See, is the service manager for both. So she should be having that availability metrics.\n\nHave you had any issues because of database going down or any of the DP two components going down?\n\nSo from from my experience with live person, no the the the I mean there there are I mean they they P2 might have an incident here and there but it which is also impacting on net banking and order order or other applications that lives on it but the the database we we never we haven\u0027t had any incident in that space that impacting \n\n. That\u0027s the shared component and you can have like their own slowness sometimes and all, but that\u0027s just like normal infra problems that we feel or that has like OK suppose sometimes like your DB and the maintenance or something like that, but that doesn\u0027t actually contribute to this live person.\n\nSo DB is just one component and the API is one of the major components through which we actually talk to them.\n\nThe downtime we haven\u0027t seen much downtime because if given that they are shared or used, users are infrastructure which hosts a lot of API.\n\nIf that infrastructure goes down, it\u0027s because of a cloud problem and not particularly because of this API having issue.\n\nYeah, that gets resolved quickly. Yes, it gets resolved, and otherwise it\u0027s not incident it. It might be that you make a change has been pushed by a change team and that causes a defect.\n\nAnd that the reports available I\u0027ll conflict to you both. If you want the latest one.\n\none of the areas we are challenges with the past was the Akamai layer. Investigate high number of Errors and there was rate limiting considerations and I guess it\u0027s it\u0027s it\u0027s it\u0027s probably a good use case for yeah, we\u0027re relying on this Akamai layer as a component because that\u0027s I guess when the integration point into CBA hits the Akamai layer.\nI know we had to closely troubleshoot that one, but I think it\u0027s an example of where we don\u0027t have, you know, visibility of like an availability metric as such. \n\nIt it\u0027s not, it\u0027s it\u0027s more reactive in terms of you know that team who look after that economy layer had to reach out to us and say hang on you guys are getting a lot of errors on coming in from traffic from live person. You know there was Web hook errors and all that don\u0027t want to get into this now but as an example of one of the pain points in terms of like one of the components that we rely on that if it\u0027s has issues then the overall service end to end service degrades.\n\nadd one more pin point that we have or we have seen or it happens product. I mean like at times, so we what happens in this live person is whenever a customer talks right we the agent what they will do is they will send a push notification to the customers for them to accept that push and then they can start the chat with the with the agent what we have seen is given that push is a very. I\u0027m in the infrastructure. How it comes is very complicated, so it\u0027s an we have something at live person.\nAnd I\u0027ll be our agents initiating that. And then it goes to IVR and after that it goes to see. Then it goes to CD then after that it goes to MP and then it comes to and then it is sent to Google or APN service for the customer to receive push. And we have beans. I mean recently might be test stopped but till two months back we were getting a lot of errors like that where the when from an agent tries to send an push to the customer right? That\u0027s also one of the pinpoints might be it has not happening in anymore now because there has been some changes done in IBS space and all. But that\u0027s also I think if we can I can bring to your attention. I mean like it gets auto resolved very quickly and we don\u0027t have enough traces to figure it out. OK where exactly it is broken down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\""

It\u0027s also available in a different, you know, in that\u0027s available on on the Commonwealth Commbank website. You know, like you you once, once a person logged into net bank you like, can you know just just give you an example.

Two, they they\u0027ve only recently migrated over to DP 2 from DP1 DP One was correct me for wrong  that was AWS. Was it? Yeah, it was. So there was limitations there on AWS.

Not all the scenarios can be tested, but I\u0027ll say very limited scenarios can be tested.\n\nAnd what about live persons or nuance themselves? dedicated for like CBA or the group. \nAnd I think it\u0027s called elfar something, but we we never have much details behind it. I believe they do. Here\u0027s the same code for for new ones as well. They do have a test environment on their side.\n\nAnd I guess that in itself we can maybe mention there about when we need to do a penetration test.\n\nYou know, live person need to make that environment available.

So the the part that\u0027s we have visibility of every month, we have a I suppose a a monthly operations session with live person where they provide what the availability for that month we\u0027re reviewing is and it only looks at whether up time for live person on their side so.\n\nAnd they provide calculated based on any any known outages. So we and I suppose just on that as well we we we\u0027ve struggled with them for example when we have an incident we had won an early April.\n\nAnd live person didn\u0027t acknowledge that this was an outage in, in, in the sense that it caused negative impact on the uptime of the CBA service. So I think they said it was a 7 minute out which when in reality it was more like a 7, seven and a half hour.\n\nAnd impact to the business cause. Again it it it involves the holder bot and that actually put a lot of more traffic to our contact center agents. So they took a long time to clear the queues that was caused by that issue. So I guess in terms the question availability, we calculate we define it in terms of what we want to do ideally is calculated into wind messaging solution, not just the live person SAS portion. We don\u0027t have good.\n\nAnd are any grasp of once the the solution from the demarcation points of comes into the CBA side where it hits the APIs and all the systems that hang in between like C engine, PGA, Kafka stream we don\u0027t have calculated that as in the totality of the entire service. So I guess that\u0027s.\n\nYeah, that\u0027s pretty much it. You know, I\u0027ll just add to like to add that when we are talking about availability, we just don\u0027t consider life person because life person is just one part of the entire chat solution. So we have something as a front end, we call it as CBA and that is something that we use for more on bank app and that bank and using that customers can send messages and talk to agent at that in terms talk to live person. So live person not available in itself is an incident but then.\n\nThere\u0027s, I mean, there\u0027s not much we can use of for life person as well. So that also is a factor that contributes to availability.\n\nLike integrations like VRC. So if any of those are down as well, again basically it impacts the entire solution. So I will beauty must be when we are targeting or understanding what is the availability we just need we need to ensure all the touch points for that particular solution are available to the customer.

So live chats is as you know speak for itself. It\u0027s it\u0027s instant messaging between our consumers and our live chat agents. Instant messaging take WhatsApp for example while messaging is more like you can you can message an agent for certain product inquiries. It can be parked.\n\nAnd it can\u0027t be responded at certain times when I would assets, you know consumers.\n\nAnd that\u0027s when what we the whole board comes into place. So the message that that queued, that\u0027s part it\u0027s it\u0027s activated by a holder bolts holding that message until such time when the consumers are ready to come back and have a chat.\n\nSo that\u0027s basically the offline messaging part.\n\nUh, so according to them. The chat is 100% available, whereas only the holder bar.\n\nIt just it just features that that cute, that whole that message is for messaging.\n\nWhenever they release hot fixes in in Lloyd Pearson Environment and and take this into consideration, we are not the only tenants that they that have that been set-up on this environment is the I think they got Westpac and they got Telstra whatever but every time they release this this hot fixes it triggered our whole about to be reset when that reset when that reset happened it basically tip all the.\n\nCute messages to sorry, turn the queue messages into active and basically it\u0027s created a lot of panic for for the agents that come online at 8:00 o\u0027clock to say how come all these messages been responding back to the customers so they have to quickly respond back to to these customers or they can put that message back to hold about like manually divertimento hold about 1 by 1.\n\nDonna, just to explain, see these holder box basically will be used when a customer is or a person using CBA is trying to talk to a actual human or agent. That\u0027s where these comes in picture. They\u0027ll hold and then they\u0027ll release it. So in case if they\u0027re down or there is a problem with them, I mean the automatic chat chat will work or the automated component of it will work. But the human component, right, that\u0027s where we start seeing issues because we have like.\n\nGiven an X number of agents only and what will happen? What happens? Is like OK, suddenly they\u0027ll get like 200 conversations. I really there\u0027s an amount that should be assigned to them at any point of time.\n\nAnd which mostly should always be in an open state. So all these issues that we start we\u0027re having for.\n\nIt was like a all these agents were getting flooded or they were getting close conversations and those stuffs.\n\nI mean, because of this life person change when they do a deployment, ideally you\u0027re holder boats right, they will hold your conversations.\n\nWhat happened is or what we have seen recently is we never do a deployment and do a restart. All the conversations which are hold by the which are holded by the holder bot is gets released.\n\nYeah, but back to that point as well it it just if it\u0027s a control release, it is fine. We we have you know we we have live person on standby they they have a they have a method of of watching you know monitoring the the horrible service make sure it doesn\u0027t tip over but it it\u0027s only when when they have emergency releases which is they according to them.\n\nThe whichever the the team that do this hot fixes, they don\u0027t get notified. The service management team. So therefore what they\u0027re not aware that that it in a short period of time, they could just say we pushing it hot fixes in the next two hours and in the middle of the night for example. So no one really across it and therefore we couldn\u0027t do it planning obviously and and when obviously they pushing the hot fixes, this is what causes all the drama reason they say.\n\nSo we we had a about 3P twos in the last two months are related to hoverboards. Yes, we do have an incident covered it, but as I said, if it\u0027s a plan deployment we we do have a you know we we raise the change in our system to say you know the FBI change as you know live person about to do deployment whatever. And then we have a control in place where you know Vibhu\u0027s team would do a health check.\n\nAfter every change, make sure everything is up and running and live person service management team will do the same as well. OK, but.\n\nAs I said, only the hot fix that causes a lot of issues.\n\nAnd just putting the incident number and the and the teams chat there as well, if you want it \n\nIncident related to hotfix: IM3782574 - Live Person - high queues  Size 8000 + - Live person , Agents not able to respond\n\nHere is an incident showing challenges with dependent components the messaging solution rely on on the CBA side: P3 IM3686067- Genesys NEO - \u003cCall Dropping Upon Deflection\u003e\n\nThe proxy network incident (P1 incident) we referred to:\n\nIM3543037 - LivePerson - slow and timing out for agents\n\nC6884673 - CR for the proxy issue\n\nwhat about the other components? do you have availability defined for metrics defined for this, not just defined eyes? Are they available?\n\nAnd DP 2, the digital platform 2, which is hosted on Microsoft Azure, we we get.\n\nMonthly reporting for that? Umm, and we can provide that. So that\u0027s that\u0027s mostly where all the, I suppose not all the APIs but majority of them. But there are other components then downstream from that they\u0027re outside of that if you want to show up in there.\n\nit\u0027s an API that\u0027s sitting on the DP to platform. We do get a availability report on this on monthly basis. I can share the report you guys as well and just be mindful it it\u0027s not obviously it\u0027s not just how API\u0027s that that utilized DP 2 there\u0027s there\u0027s hundreds of so. So yeah we do.\n\nalso have a database component where the API stock to that.\n\nthat\u0027s hosted in a shared environment, but then we have the availability metrics and all that will be available. We just need to talk to the service concerns, service managers.\n\nCaroline will be having both. See, is the service manager for both. So she should be having that availability metrics.\n\nHave you had any issues because of database going down or any of the DP two components going down?\n\nSo from from my experience with live person, no the the the I mean there there are I mean they they P2 might have an incident here and there but it which is also impacting on net banking and order order or other applications that lives on it but the the database we we never we haven\u0027t had any incident in that space that impacting \n\n. That\u0027s the shared component and you can have like their own slowness sometimes and all, but that\u0027s just like normal infra problems that we feel or that has like OK suppose sometimes like your DB and the maintenance or something like that, but that doesn\u0027t actually contribute to this live person.\n\nSo DB is just one component and the API is one of the major components through which we actually talk to them.\n\nThe downtime we haven\u0027t seen much downtime because if given that they are shared or used, users are infrastructure which hosts a lot of API.\n\nIf that infrastructure goes down, it\u0027s because of a cloud problem and not particularly because of this API having issue.\n\nYeah, that gets resolved quickly. Yes, it gets resolved, and otherwise it\u0027s not incident it. It might be that you make a change has been pushed by a change team and that causes a defect.\n\nAnd that the reports available I\u0027ll conflict to you both. If you want the latest one.\n\none of the areas we are challenges with the past was the Akamai layer. Investigate high number of Errors and there was rate limiting considerations and I guess it\u0027s it\u0027s it\u0027s it\u0027s probably a good use case for yeah, we\u0027re relying on this Akamai layer as a component because that\u0027s I guess when the integration point into CBA hits the Akamai layer.\nI know we had to closely troubleshoot that one, but I think it\u0027s an example of where we don\u0027t have, you know, visibility of like an availability metric as such. \n\nIt it\u0027s not, it\u0027s it\u0027s more reactive in terms of you know that team who look after that economy layer had to reach out to us and say hang on you guys are getting a lot of errors on coming in from traffic from live person. You know there was Web hook errors and all that don\u0027t want to get into this now but as an example of one of the pain points in terms of like one of the components that we rely on that if it\u0027s has issues then the overall service end to end service degrades.\n\nadd one more pin point that we have or we have seen or it happens product. I mean like at times, so we what happens in this live person is whenever a customer talks right we the agent what they will do is they will send a push notification to the customers for them to accept that push and then they can start the chat with the with the agent what we have seen is given that push is a very. I\u0027m in the infrastructure. How it comes is very complicated, so it\u0027s an we have something at live person.\nAnd I\u0027ll be our agents initiating that. And then it goes to IVR and after that it goes to see. Then it goes to CD then after that it goes to MP and then it comes to and then it is sent to Google or APN service for the customer to receive push. And we have beans. I mean recently might be test stopped but till two months back we were getting a lot of errors like that where the when from an agent tries to send an push to the customer right? That\u0027s also one of the pinpoints might be it has not happening in anymore now because there has been some changes done in IBS space and all. But that\u0027s also I think if we can I can bring to your attention. I mean like it gets auto resolved very quickly and we don\u0027t have enough traces to figure it out. OK where exactly it is broken down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\""

So as we\u0027ve said, there is a lot of APIs onboarded to log it, for example.\nAnd but there isn\u0027t anything correlating to tie up where the alerts are as being centered to categorize them.

And rather than you know I know that obviously 5 nines is very you know more closer to things like payment systems but. \nThe importance this has uh and as you say, customer facing and the expectation and from our business stakeholders that the up time is there\u0027s no appetite for any outages and you know that\u0027s what I mean by that statement basically it\u0027s not that designing thing documented as such that expectation is 5 nines it\u0027s it\u0027s what we\u0027re finding you know when we do have those issues is you guys you gotta get this system back up and running ASAP and that\u0027s why we\u0027ve had P1 incidents basically for the system.\n\nYeah, if we were starting from scratch, building system from scratch and we went to the business say, what\u0027s your requirement for up time? Do you know, you know, they might say close to 4 nines, but yeah, it\u0027s, yeah, it\u0027s something that\u0027s where the expectation is and what the reality is a very different.\n\nSo if the IT is down it like it creates a lot of noise. I mean, we\u0027ll start hearing from like directly entree, I mean direct banking, the call center volume suits up to about 300%, all the Twitters and all so.\n\nCBA itself is nuanced, but then we have when we want to talk to agents and all right, when the actual transfer and all. \n\nSo from Saber, you know it\u0027s Sabi Domatic chat on. So whenever I\u0027m a customer consumer want to talk to an agent and say bar will do the handover. I know what that conversation to messaging and that\u0027s when sibo go. Here you go. The land it over to live person and live person service of the kicked in and will take all that messages and we\u0027ll we\u0027ll get the the real life agent talking to the customer\n\nLike the system defined der it it\u0027s not a, you know, we say about what answer the we\u0027ll pick the most accurate answers for whatever question being asked. And yeah, that that\u0027s alright. That\u0027s it. It\u0027s it\u0027s a back end, you know? Like just just take a I don\u0027t wanna put it like Siri or OK Google for example it can.\n\nMessaging and live. Live chat. It\u0027s also available in a different, you know, in that\u0027s available on on the Commonwealth Commbank website. You know, like you you once, once a person logged into net bank you like, can you know just just give you an example. If they apply for a credit card you see a live chat like a little balloon pop up near them. So you want you need help. You wanna chat to an agent it will still be available.\n\nThere\u0027s when we talk about the chat and messaging solution, you know when we were far to chat that that\u0027s where it what he was referring to there the CBA automated chat and again not to confuse matters.

Yeah entry point you can come in via IVR deflection there\u0027s an entry point.\n\nIs why that automated chat and there\u0027s there\u0027s a couple others as well, but I guess we would point there.\n\nWhat is the Ciba portion when when there is, you know when there\u0027s an any outage there with in relation to that that side of things that that\u0027s that is a knock on effect then you know because our you know business see that as you know they look at the chat and messaging solution holistically kind of thing.\n\""

So I guess, yeah, there\u0027s there has been challenges there historically.\n\nWould it be better to have those environments matching prod so you can do better testing? There are components and features that when the the business rollout that others limitations known limitations with low environments obviously that\u0027s not that they can\u0027t you know comprehensive end to end test and when you deploy to production sometimes more often than not it will be deploying that component to broken for the first time and doing the test there so yeah\n\nuntil very recently I mentioned the API\u0027s are hosted on DP. Two, they they\u0027ve only recently migrated over to DP 2 from DP1 DP One was correct me for wrong  that was AWS. Was it? Yeah, it was. So there was limitations there on AWS. What components in the interim environment now since we\u0027ve moved over to DPP two, I understand. There, there\u0027s a couple of dependencies, but you know there it it can be brought up to the same level they understand.

So that\u0027s also one pinpoint there are scenarios.\n\nThings which had can be tested internally are fine, but then we\u0027re actually testing where we need to connect to nuance or like person and test, right. Not all the scenarios can be tested, but I\u0027ll say very limited scenarios can be tested.\n\nAnd what about live persons or nuance themselves? dedicated for like CBA or the group. \nAnd I think it\u0027s called elfar something, but we we never have much details behind it. I believe they do. Here\u0027s the same code for for new ones as well. They do have a test environment on their side.\n\nAnd I guess that in itself we can maybe mention there about when we need to do a penetration test.\n\nYou know, live person need to make that environment available. It\u0027s not available, you know, readily available to us. It\u0027s like a shared environment that they you know distributed among their their customers.\n\ndoes it have any any limitations or any, is there anything you find missing?  they can make the same functionality available \nin terms of like them being able to configure the same agent skill levels or some some, some data that needs to be there behind the scenes for this to happen so. They came back with a few different technical solutions and it it kind of it. It seemed to me that they couldn\u0027t. configure that. And clone environmental, you know the the the to the same level as production, I don\u0027t think you you probably close that feature.\n\nI  don\u0027t think they can. And and and there are they said that there\u0027s there\u0027s are there. There are databases that require to be obviously integrated with the back end.\n\nthey do have a test environment.

That\u0027s yes, that\u0027s so that was my next, if it\u0027s not Telstra and Optus, we had one issue among asked, I mean within CBA where there was a proxy change which at our in our network layer which was not allowing this live person traffic to flow through our network. So anyone who\u0027s inside the CBA network and will try to open this live person.\nIt was, it was like this URL that we have for live person\n\nSo just back to remember something there, ition of resilience, right. And I mentioned about the answers the business provide and the ARC review, the resilience really if the messaging solution is down the fall back as was the business, the contingency, the backup there is they use the voice path, you know that customers can still call call into the bank that that\u0027s the way they look at it I guess vice versa if the voice paths down messaging is up.\nSo I think you know in the grand scheme of things that that\u0027s, I suppose 1000 foot view resilience. But I think what what what you guys referring to is resilience or the solution itself into. And so I just want to kind of that out there.\n\""

                  "answer": "3 holder bot p2 as mentioned earlier session webhook errors ivr deflection see slide in chat\n\n\"So most majority of our P2 in the last two months was related to hold about and that was discussed earlier, Steven, around how the hot fixes triggered that message has to be tipped over and and and causes a lot of panic in of the business when they come back come online at 8:00 AM.\nAnd it and the that was I think it was three consecutive P2.\n\nSo we had the two other type of issue. The other was related to webhook errors.\nAnd we also have a, you know, a interrelated issue of IVR deflection.\n\nAnd the the breakdown of where the incidents resided on. Yeah, this is Nick mentioned four war on the live person SAS platform and there was three internal to CBA systems. \n\nStrategic solution that\u0027s gonna replace the technical solution that you\u0027ve got now, is there anything you can tell us about that?\n3rd within live person there is an existing capability called auto close whereby if a customer does not interact with the conversation within a determined period of time or a defined period of time, auto close will gracefully close that conversation after it follows a few protocols and steps.\nUmm, because Commonwealth Bank hasn\u0027t engaged with the SDK version of the live person solution and we have more of a bespoke experience with that particular vendor.\nIntegration doesn\u0027t actually account for or cater for the auto close.\nIt it has inherent productivity benefits. So what was developed by a live person, the vendor was to use some of their existing.\nUmm RPAY or automation to pick up chats that were assigned to a particular queue and move it to auto close so it would act as an enabler for that feature that we are unable to or previously unable to unlock based on our integration type.\nI\u0027m not technical so I couldn\u0027t tell you what those prohibitions are. I might just know that it\u0027s because we don\u0027t engage with the kind of full as a service SDK, so the auto close solution in order for us to, I guess, manage that in our native code, we needed to make some changes to obviously get off the conversation holder bot. So what?\nWe\u0027ve done is manage some of the logic in native and within our back end code to filter out some web hooks. As I understand it, and that enables us to use auto close as a function as it was designed to. But because we\u0027re making an additional call to an API, we do expect.\nThe increase in line with how often we\u0027re calling that API, we\u0027re expecting an increase in.\nUmm 505 hundred errors I believe simply because like based on we\u0027re calling something more frequent.\nUM, with that auto close solution.\n\nyou mentioned that you are not using the SDK. Is it like an SDK like L live person SDK or is it? Something different.\nYeah, we\u0027re not using live persons SDK.\n\nquestion on this 500 errors. So we\u0027ll so is that being monitored somehow like how many new 500 errors you\u0027re getting and?And I suspect there may be some kind of a latency or.Some issues around that.\n\nSo we know that what is the cause of the error is mostly because of some DB Sloan. It\u0027s it\u0027s like it\u0027s like it is happening from a long time and mostly it has slowly increased as and when the traffic increases on the live person side for the conversations. So there is like a some latency issue between the web calls and then when we talk to our database.\nThough and we captured that in this Splunk, we know we are aware that it happens.\nSo it\u0027s captured to answer and what is the root cause? We pretty much know it\u0027s because of some DB settings in our end plus the high amount of traffic that is sent from live person.\nSo I mean obviously there is, there is probably an increase or even doubling the number of calls within a short period.\n\nThis web hook all the related functionality now that it will be hosted on DP2? That\u0027s correct, yes.\n\nnow there\u0027s an additional computing that\u0027s happening on, on CBA platforms.?\ncomputing, CBA platforms, DP 2 plus, there\u0027s a database components also. So the DP two component will talk to our SQL component where this conversations are stored in all as well.\n\nfrom an uh live person standpoint, have they is this is this their recommended solution like in terms of have they implemented with other clients and is that what? Their standard fixes.\nBut it\u0027s something like designed by, like CBA teams. Not be able to answer it\u0027s it\u0027s it. It would have been a collective effort and dwarak with the architect from CBA as well as architects from live person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\""

It was tactical and it is this, the strategic solution will be going in the next couple of weeks to replace that.\nSo in terms of a strategic remediation, we do have something in the works for that. And when ???? joins, she\u0027d be able to talk to that in more detail as well.\n\nAnd in addition to these, we had couple of P threes which were resolved very quickly. They were related to some C slowness and all. So whenever we have C slowness, it\u0027s a shared environment. Customer might not receive notifications sent from the agents via push or anything like any other channels. So that was also one of the symptoms that we saw in addition to the Liveperson holder bot issues.\n\nWas gonna say that\u0027s a good point of view because that that one you referring to there, it was managed as a P3 incident. But I I could argue, yeah, you know we treated it at a much higher priority and we had numerous walkthrough sessions and the complexity involved and everything and presenting the findings back. Yeah, that\u0027s a good call out to have that one as well considered.\n\nFor a follow up on that, have you like, have you had like a P1 or P2 instance that was subsequently downgraded to like P3 or P4?\n\nThese are way around work, so you should start really three and then we go to two.\n\nSo for from lower priority to higher priority we go generally, but once we you know declare as a P1 or P2 which generally don\u0027t downgrade rather if the issue is resolved we we close the the incident.\n\nSo I just gave an example. It was I think it was raised as a P3 and then subsequently missed raised as a P2 and we did some analysis, but it was lost somewhere between CIS space and all and mu a new contacts intervals also set-up during the same time. So customers. So people at the call centers where it is in concerned. So it was mix and match of multiple factors.\nBut it\u0027s all lies in that space. See IVR CD.\n\nSo yeah, so on incident management from the right one, just want to highlight one one important thing like when we have P1P2, if it\u0027s related to live percent, we have to action we we get team engaged and we get some solution whether we without SLA maybe in one or two day. But when issues related to code we we we need to have something in place so that.\n\nThat\u0027s very book error is something but it can be something related to code or it can be something related to other aspects. So ??? error is partly fixed now, but we still have issues and when we see the errors we are not sure since when.\n\nAnd and I think on that ??? as well, probably while we\u0027re on that same topic, we we\u0027ve definitely seen cases where an incident maybe P4 or P3, but the first I suppose decision tree is we check is live person up on as a SAS up and we check the status their page and more often than not with these ones we\u0027re discussing it is so you didn\u0027t kind of look at the other components or hosted on CBA side and.\nYou know, I I\u0027ve had cases where we\u0027ve had to stand up, you know, meetings equivalent to a high priority SITMAN bridge just to get the likes of, you know, ??? from TCS and the call live person, you know, people not just called people from Alex\u0027s team sometimes and we may as well you know be treating it as a high priority incident because I guess you know again I think that kind of goes back to the complexity of the messaging solution intertwined.\n\""

I just wanna start off by saying look that there there\u0027s known gaps with monitoring alerting we have a risk insight issue, medium rated issue raised which was I\u0027m actually risk accepted earlier on this year there there\u0027s again back to there\u0027s known gaps recently. I know Harish has done a lot of research into what\u0027s there in terms of Splunk luggage and there\u0027s there\u0027s elements of.\nYou know alarm set that are there, but they haven\u0027t really been tied up in terms of categorized in terms of which ones constitute a high priority incident. So I guess in terms of, yeah, it\u0027s well established that there are gaps and I think there is there\u0027s some elements monitored on on luggage and maybe vibhu. SCOM, I think as well for probably, yeah.\n\nI can answer better current so so. So I think we observed, you know, migration to time from I believe DP DP one was the first migration then we have DP two. So in this migration I think a lot of little monitoring which we are which were there became absolute. So I can\u0027t confirm for all the monitoring because to confirm I need to have understanding on the the solution and each component because the monitoring maybe not just required for live person and domains or the database or.\nThe main components, but there are other comments. Left Calf, CE and other components which are related to messaging. We also need to understand if you have monitoring in place. So overall I can say 40%. I I see that we have monitoring in place from APD. We have some monitoring plays and from spleen and we also have something from escom.\nBut I I I can\u0027t confirm that every monitoring is in place is working because those I too don\u0027t have access everywhere. So but majorly I think 3 places we have monitoring place APPT, ASCOM and.\n\ncan you elaborate what this on this s s com?\nI can\u0027t say for sure because I don\u0027t have access to S com actually, but some of the information I I get from blog it you know from SCOM.\nthe environment which is not there in DP2, like for example we have a database.\nSo some monitoring is there from database like space monitoring that that we have that CPU spikes memory spikes.\nBut mostly it checks the heartbeat of the corresponding infrastructure and in case if there is this I\u0027m not slowness in case if it\u0027s unreachable we will get an alert telling that OK there is a slowness or this is not available at all.\nwould you be able to tell us what that risk Insite numbers so we can have a look?\nThis one IM3779900\n\nHere is the Risk Insite reference for the monitoring alerting gap: IS-137744 - Monitoring gaps for Chat and Messaging (Medium rated)\n\n\n\""

I\u0027ll just give you like, I\u0027ll take five minutes and explain to you. Kill switches are mostly 2 kill a functionality.\nSo suppose live person is broken due to some reasons and we are getting a lot of complaints. And we are, we don\u0027t know what exactly is happening. So what we\u0027ll do is we\u0027ll have a kill switch in place if we switch off that, that function itself will be closed. So there\u0027ll be no more traffic to live person.\n\nWe are doing a prod deployment where the we expect an outage.\nOr high priority, if you will not be tools.\n\nBut from a consumer standpoint, would they still see the chat option or so it\u0027s going to, it\u0027s going to switch off the widget as well, right?\nIt was going to that depends. So we have multiple kids switches for various functions.\nSo depending on which is the kill switch, we are going to switch off. That particular function will not be available.\n\nBut we do, I think the the message when for customer when they try to use that, if you\u0027re never that kill switches say something, the messaging or live chat is currently not available.\n\nSo you have like this is part of your standard standard operation procedure or is it like a? Something that is\nIt it\u0027s, it\u0027s there, it\u0027s there, the direct, but it\u0027s based on the the business requirement. If they want to turn that on and off we we can action that under the under the change and then P2 minimum.\n\nJust to give you an example. Like suppose we have a deployment direct where we know that there will be like 30 minutes outage for CBA or we foresee that and we don\u0027t want any customer transaction to happen during that time. Then we start we disable this switch so that function itself is closed. We go ahead make our changes, send the comms and enable it. After our changes are done.\n\n\""

I think the more that chat and messaging has scaled probably has we\u0027ve seen an increase in the number of incidents reported on these because it\u0027s been used more. But that\u0027s was that\u0027s contact center vibhu do you have any insights into what wider than that in dot from your experience?\n\nNo. So I\u0027ll just have to check that direct. What is the report that you are running because whatever you are running is like a bit higher than what we expect at our end.\n\nSo the configuration. Basically I think the CMDB number for live person, but I think some of the results returned were also different instance. Some of them were related to SO outage some SSL search not being installed search that\u0027s probably a company wide outage, right?\nYeah, it can. It might be any incident where, like we would have added this this live person as a impacted CI, it would have resulted all those it would have returned all those results.\nSo that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying it\u0027s not an accurate measure. But in general like how does how does the number of incidents related to live person stack against.\nOther similar systems like CBS that can give an idea as to. At the health. Again, that might depend on which system you\u0027re comparison, because we have multiple functions, so some of the functions we know are buggy and we\u0027ll get.like incidents and then some of there are some functions which are very stable. It will be very difficult to tell, but having said that, as Harish and Nick told right, the amount of incidents that we get against any other system related to live person live person is relatively small.\n\nSo so dorai I may be able to explain. So it depends totally on how you are filtering the data. In my service was no to get the incident count. So if you if you\u0027re searching based on effected CI definitely it will not be directly related live person but some other components or maybe some somewhere might not related to live person and in fact if if you see direct relationship with live person so most of the incidents are intermittent which are resolved automatically that. So I can say it\u0027s it will be around 40 percent, 40% incident will be intermittent and there will be a mostly a incidents related to contacts interferent like for example IVR deflection Click to call. And yeah, so to be frank, uh, for incident I I think that, uh live person should have more incidents in place as per user experiences you know consistent. So if if you when we have one to one maybe later on like you mentioned I can show you know what we have the number of errors and proactively I think there should create some additional incidents to fix those issues.\n\nAnd just to add that like we are very good at at least creating incidents. So as soon as I mean it can be anything like even if it is a J scaler issue or like our we I mean as soon as the agent faces the issue, we do go ahead and create that incident so. we just need to filter and see which one is. which one is actually a light personal issue and which can be a network issue or SOJ skill issues?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\""

The other was related to webhook errors.\nAnd we also have a, you know, a interrelated issue of IVR deflection.\n\nAnd the the breakdown of where the incidents resided on. Yeah, this is Nick mentioned four war on the live person SAS platform and there was three internal to CBA systems. \n\nStrategic solution that\u0027s gonna replace the technical solution that you\u0027ve got now, is there anything you can tell us about that?\n3rd within live person there is an existing capability called auto close whereby if a customer does not interact with the conversation within a determined period of time or a defined period of time, auto close will gracefully close that conversation after it follows a few protocols and steps.\nUmm, because Commonwealth Bank hasn\u0027t engaged with the SDK version of the live person solution and we have more of a bespoke experience with that particular vendor.\nIntegration doesn\u0027t actually account for or cater for the auto close.\nIt it has inherent productivity benefits. So what was developed by a live person, the vendor was to use some of their existing.\nUmm RPAY or automation to pick up chats that were assigned to a particular queue and move it to auto close so it would act as an enabler for that feature that we are unable to or previously unable to unlock based on our integration type.\nI\u0027m not technical so I couldn\u0027t tell you what those prohibitions are. I might just know that it\u0027s because we don\u0027t engage with the kind of full as a service SDK, so the auto close solution in order for us to, I guess, manage that in our native code, we needed to make some changes to obviously get off the conversation holder bot. So what?\nWe\u0027ve done is manage some of the logic in native and within our back end code to filter out some web hooks. As I understand it, and that enables us to use auto close as a function as it was designed to. But because we\u0027re making an additional call to an API, we do expect.\nThe increase in line with how often we\u0027re calling that API, we\u0027re expecting an increase in.\nUmm 505 hundred errors I believe simply because like based on we\u0027re calling something more frequent.\nUM, with that auto close solution.\n\nyou mentioned that you are not using the SDK. Is it like an SDK like L live person SDK or is it? Something different.\nYeah, we\u0027re not using live persons SDK.\n\nquestion on this 500 errors. So we\u0027ll so is that being monitored somehow like how many new 500 errors you\u0027re getting and?And I suspect there may be some kind of a latency or.Some issues around that.\n\nSo we know that what is the cause of the error is mostly because of some DB Sloan. It\u0027s it\u0027s like it\u0027s like it is happening from a long time and mostly it has slowly increased as and when the traffic increases on the live person side for the conversations. So there is like a some latency issue between the web calls and then when we talk to our database.\nThough and we captured that in this Splunk, we know we are aware that it happens.\nSo it\u0027s captured to answer and what is the root cause? We pretty much know it\u0027s because of some DB settings in our end plus the high amount of traffic that is sent from live person.\nSo I mean obviously there is, there is probably an increase or even doubling the number of calls within a short period.\n\nThis web hook all the related functionality now that it will be hosted on DP2? That\u0027s correct, yes.\n\nnow there\u0027s an additional computing that\u0027s happening on, on CBA platforms.?\ncomputing, CBA platforms, DP 2 plus, there\u0027s a database components also. So the DP two component will talk to our SQL component where this conversations are stored in all as well.\n\nfrom an uh live person standpoint, have they is this is this their recommended solution like in terms of have they implemented with other clients and is that what? Their standard fixes.\nBut it\u0027s something like designed by, like CBA teams. Not be able to answer it\u0027s it\u0027s it. It would have been a collective effort and dwarak with the architect from CBA as well as architects from live person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\""

It was tactical and it is this, the strategic solution will be going in the next couple of weeks to replace that.\nSo in terms of a strategic remediation, we do have something in the works for that. And when ???? joins, she\u0027d be able to talk to that in more detail as well.\n\nAnd in addition to these, we had couple of P threes which were resolved very quickly. They were related to some C slowness and all. So whenever we have C slowness, it\u0027s a shared environment. Customer might not receive notifications sent from the agents via push or anything like any other channels. So that was also one of the symptoms that we saw in addition to the Liveperson holder bot issues.\n\nWas gonna say that\u0027s a good point of view because that that one you referring to there, it was managed as a P3 incident. But I I could argue, yeah, you know we treated it at a much higher priority and we had numerous walkthrough sessions and the complexity involved and everything and presenting the findings back. Yeah, that\u0027s a good call out to have that one as well considered.\n\nFor a follow up on that, have you like, have you had like a P1 or P2 instance that was subsequently downgraded to like P3 or P4?\n\nThese are way around work, so you should start really three and then we go to two.\n\nSo for from lower priority to higher priority we go generally, but once we you know declare as a P1 or P2 which generally don\u0027t downgrade rather if the issue is resolved we we close the the incident.\n\nSo I just gave an example. It was I think it was raised as a P3 and then subsequently missed raised as a P2 and we did some analysis, but it was lost somewhere between CIS space and all and mu a new contacts intervals also set-up during the same time. So customers. So people at the call centers where it is in concerned. So it was mix and match of multiple factors.\nBut it\u0027s all lies in that space. See IVR CD.\n\nSo yeah, so on incident management from the right one, just want to highlight one one important thing like when we have P1P2, if it\u0027s related to live percent, we have to action we we get team engaged and we get some solution whether we without SLA maybe in one or two day. But when issues related to code we we we need to have something in place so that.\n\nThat\u0027s very book error is something but it can be something related to code or it can be something related to other aspects. So ??? error is partly fixed now, but we still have issues and when we see the errors we are not sure since when.\n\nAnd and I think on that ??? as well, probably while we\u0027re on that same topic, we we\u0027ve definitely seen cases where an incident maybe P4 or P3, but the first I suppose decision tree is we check is live person up on as a SAS up and we check the status their page and more often than not with these ones we\u0027re discussing it is so you didn\u0027t kind of look at the other components or hosted on CBA side and.\nYou know, I I\u0027ve had cases where we\u0027ve had to stand up, you know, meetings equivalent to a high priority SITMAN bridge just to get the likes of, you know, ??? from TCS and the call live person, you know, people not just called people from Alex\u0027s team sometimes and we may as well you know be treating it as a high priority incident because I guess you know again I think that kind of goes back to the complexity of the messaging solution intertwined.\n\""

I just wanna start off by saying look that there there\u0027s known gaps with monitoring alerting we have a risk insight issue, medium rated issue raised which was I\u0027m actually risk accepted earlier on this year there there\u0027s again back to there\u0027s known gaps recently.

SCOM, I think as well for probably, yeah.\n\nI can answer better current so so. So I think we observed, you know, migration to time from I believe DP DP one was the first migration then we have DP two. So in this migration I think a lot of little monitoring which we are which were there became absolute. So I can\u0027t confirm for all the monitoring because to confirm I need to have understanding on the the solution and each component because the monitoring maybe not just required for live person and domains or the database or.\nThe main components, but there are other comments. Left Calf, CE and other components which are related to messaging. We also need to understand if you have monitoring in place. So overall I can say 40%. I I see that we have monitoring in place from APD. We have some monitoring plays and from spleen and we also have something from escom.\nBut I I I can\u0027t confirm that every monitoring is in place is working because those I too don\u0027t have access everywhere.

But then in that case is right, we\u0027ll have the operations team will have access to the boxes as well and that the direct Azure portals and SQL servers. So the operation team can build directly, jump into them and start looking into the ISR corresponding logs as well in addition to the Splunk and XCOM.\n\nIs there any any kind of uh single place? or some kind of a dashboard where you can see the issues coming up?\n\nNot exactly, but I\u0027m. I\u0027m trying to create one Splunk dashboard for digital conversations. So I started with the errors web errors, then API errors. Then we have something from SQL but I\u0027m too not sure for all the integration components to, you know, put that together in one place.\nSo all the integration, you know, CI\u0027s I think.\nSome validation we need to do like we have what components are related to you know messaging and what related you know monitoring we can put in place.\nIf something is related, we can definitely put in on dashboard if it\u0027s possible.\nBut all the components monitoring, I think it need to be explored.\n\nthere\u0027s another dashboard I mentioned to kind of when we hear about an incident at the decision tree, we start with OK is live person the status, their status page and that\u0027s what I put into the chat there. But I think, you know, I think what we\u0027re talking about with Harish mentioned given we know there\u0027s constraints in what limitations there is for monitoring alerting that\u0027s after the fact I suppose we know we hear about an issue then we go to Splunk and At dynamics and check is anything in there we can see that type of thing, but it\u0027s again that all comes back into the. The root cause of you know the lack of monitoring alerting in place in the first place.\n\nThat\u0027s great. And this is the space is actually, uh, will we know suggest if there is outage actually and that outage situation is kind of very rare and kind of not possible because we have you know availability.\n\nUh, you know in place from both like buzzer and nuance, but mostly issue what we have is user experience and to know the user experience we have to get in the you know the 500 is 400 days and other areas Brito API.\n\n\""

I think the more that chat and messaging has scaled probably has we\u0027ve seen an increase in the number of incidents reported on these because it\u0027s been used more. But that\u0027s was that\u0027s contact center vibhu do you have any insights into what wider than that in dot from your experience?\n\nNo. So I\u0027ll just have to check that direct. What is the report that you are running because whatever you are running is like a bit higher than what we expect at our end.\n\nSo the configuration. Basically I think the CMDB number for live person, but I think some of the results returned were also different instance. Some of them were related to SO outage some SSL search not being installed search that\u0027s probably a company wide outage, right?\nYeah, it can. It might be any incident where, like we would have added this this live person as a impacted CI, it would have resulted all those it would have returned all those results.\nSo that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying it\u0027s not an accurate measure. But in general like how does how does the number of incidents related to live person stack against.\nOther similar systems like CBS that can give an idea as to. At the health. Again, that might depend on which system you\u0027re comparison, because we have multiple functions, so some of the functions we know are buggy and we\u0027ll get.like incidents and then some of there are some functions which are very stable. It will be very difficult to tell, but having said that, as Harish and Nick told right, the amount of incidents that we get against any other system related to live person live person is relatively small.\n\nSo so dorai I may be able to explain. So it depends totally on how you are filtering the data. In my service was no to get the incident count. So if you if you\u0027re searching based on effected CI definitely it will not be directly related live person but some other components or maybe some somewhere might not related to live person and in fact if if you see direct relationship with live person so most of the incidents are intermittent which are resolved automatically that. So I can say it\u0027s it will be around 40 percent, 40% incident will be intermittent and there will be a mostly a incidents related to contacts interferent like for example IVR deflection Click to call. And yeah, so to be frank, uh, for incident I I think that, uh live person should have more incidents in place as per user experiences you know consistent. So if if you when we have one to one maybe later on like you mentioned I can show you know what we have the number of errors and proactively I think there should create some additional incidents to fix those issues.\n\nAnd just to add that like we are very good at at least creating incidents. So as soon as I mean it can be anything like even if it is a J scaler issue or like our we I mean as soon as the agent faces the issue, we do go ahead and create that incident so. we just need to filter and see which one is. which one is actually a light personal issue and which can be a network issue or SOJ skill issues?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\""

To derive meaningful results across a variety of platforms, the optimised framework primarily takes a 360-degree view of platform maturity including technology, people, process, and data.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to assess the {{.Project.Name}} maturity, stability, integrity and performance throughout the run-to-retire phase as data is possibly migrated onto new platforms.  The findings from this exercise should be read not only as an assessment of the current state of the system but also provide an actionable path to improvement. Furthermore, it should be noted that to achieve higher levels of maturity ({{.Project.Score.Global}} and up) requires coordinated, cross-organisational effort.\n\nThe assessment framework is based upon a scoring measure across a 5-point scale as an objective indicator to assess system maturity and complexity. The Framework is based upon the following maturity levels:\n\n\u003ctable class=\"table table-striped\"\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n\t\u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLevel\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eTitle\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eDescription\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003c/thead\u003e\n    \u003ctbody\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eInitial\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eSuccess depends on the competence and efforts of key individuals.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eDeveloping\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eTeam-wide process discipline is in place.

Its intent is to communicate relative strength and focus areas across several topics.\n2.\tOverall score: this is a score for the overall assessment. Its intent is to provide upper-level management a general sense of how the service is performing.\n\nThe method used to devise each of the above scores is detailed in the following sub-sections.\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"display-6\"\u003eTopic Score\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe topic score focusses on providing a relative health measure for each topic area, such as Availability and Performance.

Each criterion is associated with a maturity level (0 through to 5). Some example criteria are in the following Worked Example sub-section. \n\nWhen performing an assessment on a topic, each criterion is given a rating. Each rating, along with its associated score value is listed below:\n\n*\tNot met (0)\n*\tPartially met (0.5)\n*\tMet or Exceeded (1)\n\nThis provides us with the following interim values for the topic:\n\n*\tA max maturity for the assessment: this is one level below the maturity of the first occurrence of a “Not Met” criteria.  This is based upon the rationale that a topic’s current maturity should always fall short of the first observed unmet criteria.\n*\tA base score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias up to the max maturity\n*\tThe base number of criteria : number of criterias forming the base raw score\n*\tAn extended score : this is calculated by summing rating scores of the criterias above max maturity\n*\tThe extended number of criteria : number of criterias forming the extended raw score\n\nThe final score for this topic is then calculated as follows:\n(base score / base number of criteria * max maturity) + (extended score/extended number of criterias)\nThe final score is then rounded to 1 decimal point.\n\nThe following sub-section walks through a worked example.\nWorked Example\nBelow is a slimmed down version of the criteria for Availability topic for example purposes.
